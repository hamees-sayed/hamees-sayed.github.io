TL;DR: Epic.

This is a long novel, 600+ pages. I postponed picking this up a lot, and the monsoon finally gave me a good time to snuggle in with it. I knew I was in for a heavy story but did not expect to be in tears by the end.

The book has an awesome blurb so I won't try writing a premise:
*The time is 1975. The place is an unnamed city by the sea. The government has just declared a State of Emergency, in whose upheavals four strangers--a spirited widow, a young student uprooted from his idyllic hill station, and two tailors who have fled the caste violence of their native village--will be thrust together, forced to share one cramped apartment and an uncertain future. As the characters move from distrust to friendship and from friendship to love, A Fine Balance creates an enduring panorama of the human spirit in an inhuman state.*

These characters go through brutal struggles, and Mistry does not shy away from describing these struggles in blunt realism. The first few chapters, which lay out their individual backstories, were pretty captivating and I was enamored with the writing. A key motif throughout the novel is loneliness (and craving company). The loneliness of an independent widow. The loneliness of parents when their children go away to study or work. The loneliness of the aforementioned children.

The book is set in an unidentified "city by the sea" which is quite clearly Bombay (local trains, northern suburbs, torrential rains). I live in Bombay (now Mumbai), and I loved the descriptions of places. More generally, I think I appreciate the Indian setting and vibes -- being mostly starved of it.

The side characters were generally pretty entertaining and actually served their purpose of strengthening the characterization of our main quartet. They are the epitome of having hope, even when you're living in illegal *jhopadpattis* that survive on fragile bribes, even when you could suddenly be rounded up someday to forcefully attend a Prime Minister's address in the hot countryside or work as free labor in a random irrigation project, even when you lack limbs and your day job is literally begging. You have to maintain a fine balance between hope and despair, says Vasantrao Valmik to Maneck Kohlah. This rings so true, as we see characters succumbing to despair left and right after going through multiple harrowing experiences.

The caste violence reminded me of Satyajit Ray's *Sadgati* (which was based on Munshi Premchand's short story of the same name), but this was more depressing. It's so crushingly unfair that where one is born ends up determining so much of what they do in life.

But this book is not all sad. There are many genuinely warm moments. Triumphs after tribulations. People caring for each other and building familial ties with once-strangers. At the end of the day, I'm glad to have read *A Fine Balance*.

Here are some snippets that I really liked.

*Sometimes, the old pastime of attending free concerts tempted her, but she was reluctant to resume it. Anything which seemed like clutching at bygone days made her weary. The road towards self-reliance could not lie through the past.*
So true.

*And at home, too, there were changes he accepted with submission. After all, what other options were there? His older daughter died of tuberculosis, followed by his wife. Then his sons disappeared into the underworld, returning periodically to abuse him. The remaining daughter, just when he was beginning to think she would redeem everything, left to become a prostitute. His life, he thought, had become the plot of a bad Hindi movie minus the happy ending.*
F.

*"All day he spends stuck to his Bapa", grumbled Radha happily, surveying the adoring father and son.*
Grumbled happily. Beautiful.

*They hid the bicycle at a safe distance from Dina Dalai’s door, in a cobwebby stairwell that smelled of urine and country liquor. Chaining it to a disused gas pipe, they emerged brushing off the invisible threads clinging to their hands and faces. Ghosts of the webs continued to bother them for some time. Their fingers kept returning to their foreheads and necks to remove strands that were not there.*
I love how Mistry grabs and portrays mundane everyday moments. "Ghosts of webs" is so apt.

*Halfway through the vacation a late monsoon surge darkened the skies. Heavy rain kept the boys indoors. Bored and restless ...*
So relatable!

*With an effort, Maneck abandoned the board and went to the window. Rain was pounding the street. Someone's motorcycle lay covered under a loudly thrumming tarpaulin. The puddles around it were muddy and uninviting. There were no children playing or splashing, the street joyless in this rain that had stayed too long and was too torrential.*
Again.

*“Actually, they all got along very well.” She was aware, as she mouthed the words, that the statement did not do justice to her household. But what else to say? Could she describe for Zenobia the extent to which Maneck and Om had become inseparable, and how Ishvar regarded both boys like his own sons? That the four of them cooked together and ate together, shared the cleaning and washing and shopping and laughing and worrying? That they cared about her, and gave her more respect than she had received from some of her own relatives? That she had, during these last few months, known what was a family?*
