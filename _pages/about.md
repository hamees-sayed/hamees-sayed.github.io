Hi! I am Saikiran, a computer science MSc student at [ETH Zürich](https://inf.ethz.ch/), majoring in Visual Computing.
I did my undergraduate at the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay (IITB), receiving a BTech with Honors in Computer Science and Engineering. 
I'm currently interested in computer vision & graphics, machine learning, interpretable ML, and quantum computing.

I did my Bachelors' thesis with Prof. [Preethi Jyothi](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~pjyothi/) and Prof. [Ganesh Ramakrishnan](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~ganesh/) on self-supervised multimodal learning. 
In summer 2021, I was a data science intern at Microsoft, where I worked on vision-language models with [Swati Tiwari](https://www.linkedin.com/in/swati-tiwari-1805/) and [Neelesh Khanna](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nekhanna/).
The summer before, I was exploring Vector Addition Systems as a research intern at ENS Paris-Saclay, guided by Prof. [Alain Finkel](http://www.lsv.fr/~finkel/). 

I learn Carnatic music (a form of South Indian classical music). I also enjoy [reading](https://www.goodreads.com/skeleton-detective), [cycling](https://www.strava.com/athletes/116391594), table tennis, and swimming.
