Hi! I am Akkapaka Saikiran, and I'm a final-year undergraduate in the Computer Science and Engineering department of [IIT Bombay](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/).
I'm currently interested in machine learning, computer vision, fairness & interpretability in ML, and natural language processing.

I'm currently doing my Bachelors' Thesis Project (BTP) with Prof. [Preethi Jyothi](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~pjyothi/) and Prof. [Ganesh Ramakrishnan](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~ganesh/) on self-supervised multimodal learning. 
In the summer of 2021, I was a data science intern at Microsoft, where I worked on vision-language models for Bing ads classification with [Swati Tiwari](https://www.linkedin.com/in/swati-tiwari-1805/) and [Neelesh Khanna](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nekhanna/).
The summer before, I was exploring Vector Addition Systems as a research intern at ENS Paris-Saclay, guided by Prof. [Alain Finkel](http://www.lsv.fr/~finkel/).
