Hi there! I'm Hamees Ul Hasan, but you can call me Hamees. I'm currently pursuing my BS at Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Madras, where I'm majoring in Data Science and Application. My interests lie in Statistics, Machine Learning, Data Science, Computer Vision, Deep Learning and Open Source.

Apart from academics, I enjoy playing video games, watching anime, reading comics and books on recreational mathematics and scientific humour. I'm also a sports enthusiast and enjoy playing basketball.

I played basketball for my high school team. My favourite authors include [Martin Gardner](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/7105.Martin_Gardner) and [Randoll Munroe](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/21413662).

## **currently**
- catching up with all the pending mangas
- plotting the greatest academic comeback known to human history
